## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Import the necessary package 'java.util'
3.	Read multiple lines from the user until "exit" is entered.
4. Store only those lines that contain the word "Java".

6. Continue reading until input ends or more "Java" lines appear.
7. At EOF, print any remaining lines containing "Java".

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ThreadDetails {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read thread name from user
        String name = sc.nextLine();

        // Get current thread
        Thread t = Thread.currentThread();

        // Set the name
        t.setName(name);

        // Display required output
        System.out.println("Priority of Thread: " + t.getPriority());
        System.out.println("Name of Thread: " + t.getName());
        System.out.println(t);

        sc.close();
    }
}
```
